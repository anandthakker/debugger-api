# node-inspector-api

A thin adapter that gives direct access to [node-inspector][1]'s backend.

Normally, node-inspector is acting both as a *client*--to a process run with `node --debug`--and
also as a *server*--serving up a web(kit) frontend.  This package gives direct access to the debugger
client without having to start up the server.
